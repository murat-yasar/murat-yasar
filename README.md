Hi, this is Murat. 
I'm a full-stack web developer who creates web solutions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, PHP, MySQL, and TYPO3. 
I'm more interested in backend development and web applications.
I'm currently improving my typo3 (a cool CMS system) and its subskills (TypoScript, fluids, Extbase, etc).
My recent contribution to the open-source community is translating the ProGit2 book into Turkish.
I’m looking for a collaboration to contribute to open-source projects using JavaScript and PHP.
